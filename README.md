# philosophers

The "Philosophers" project is a common exercise in computer science and concurrent programming. It involves creating a simulation of philosophers that demonstrate concurrent behavior, competing for forks to eat and thinking. The goal is to avoid deadlocks, resource contention, and provide an understanding of threading and synchronization techniques.

# Features

* Philosopher Threads: The program creates and manages multiple threads, each representing a philosopher.

* Resource Management: Philosophers share limited resources (forks) and must synchronize their actions to prevent conflicts and deadlocks.

* Eating and Thinking: Philosophers have a sequence of eating and thinking periods. The program must simulate these actions.

* Concurrent Execution: The project provides a practical understanding of concurrent programming, using synchronization primitives like mutexes and semaphores.

* Error Handling: The program should handle errors, such as thread creation and synchronization issues.
